# Hi, I‚Äôm Tim!
I'm a passionate starting theoretical physicist and mathematician. I'm a fan of physics and mathmatics problem solving and I like to code.

## What I like to do:

**Theoretical Physics ‚öõÔ∏è**: I like all of physics and I really enjoy applying mathmatics in physics.

**Applied Mathematics üìà**: I like applying mathematics everywhere, from physics to finance and other fields.

**Pure Mathematics ‚ôæÔ∏è**: Mathematics is always beautiful and interesting.

**Coding üñ•**: Coding is very interesting and often important in applied mathematics.

## Some topics my projects cover:

**- Computer Graphics and Shaders**

**- Mathematical Modeling**

**- Game Development**

**- Quintative Finance**

**and more coming soon**

## Technologies & Languages:

**- Primary Language**: C#

**- Others**: GLSL, HLSL and Python

**- Libraries & Frameworks I have used**: OpenTK, Matplotlib, SciPy, Microsoft XNA and FNA

## I'm always open to collaboration and connection!

I'm always eager to work on projects that involve physics, mathematics, or any intersection of these fields. Whether you're interested in joint research or creating innovative solutions, feel free to reach out! I'm also open to connection. If you just want to talk about any of the things I mentioned, don't hesitate!
